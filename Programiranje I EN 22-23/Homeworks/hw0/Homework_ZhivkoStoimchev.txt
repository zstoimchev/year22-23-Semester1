Answers:

a) Programming is a proces of writing a computer program, and what that means that 
people are writing computer programs with dedicated programming language, which machines (computers) understand.
b) Program is an application that does certain task. More precisely, a program does what we tell it to do.
c) PL syntax is the programming language's key words, like grammatic in human language, which we must follow.
Otherwise, our compiler wont understand our instructions and will give us errors.
