Recursion in programming is a powerful technique for problem solving. In fact, it is a function that calls itself.
When using recursion, our code looks much cleaner and more elegant. Recursion sometimes makes the program look simpler,
but sometimes it can lead to integer overflow or memory overflow, such that we use all of our RAM memory.
Most of the time, using recursion is fine, but there are some cases, such that, when using recursion, it can lead
to more difficult-to-understand code, and harder to debug. 
Good use of recursion, is when we can broke a problem into more smaller subproblems that can be solver easily.
But sometimes, using recursion can cost performance and memory.
