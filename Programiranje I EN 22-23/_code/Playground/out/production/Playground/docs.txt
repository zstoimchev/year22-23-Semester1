abstract class

    make the super class abstract, so that, it has abstract methods, empty apstract methods.

    child classes, normal classes, inherit that methods, and overwrite them for their own options.

    the abstract methods are things thar are common for all the child classes, but have different properties.

example, canvas, has method render (renders square and circle)
    but, square is not rendered the same as circle, so we create abstract canvas class, and add abstract methods.
    int he child classes, square and circle, we overwrite that methods to work on our own calls
